    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Baked ziti is the dish I make at the annual ski retreat that my friends
      and I take each year in New England. There are few pasta bakes that are
      easier to put together yet produce such ridiculously good results,
      particularly when it's snowing outside and you've got a whole cabinful of
      friends to feed. - J. Kenji López-Alt

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound (454g) ziti, penne, or other thick tubular pasta</li>
      <li>4 cups (950ml) homemade or high-quality store-bought red sauce (such
        as Rao's), divided</li>
      <li>12 ounces (340g) whole-milk homemade or high-quality ricotta
        cheese</li>
      <li>3 ounces (85g) Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated and divided (about 1
        1/2 cups)</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup (240ml) heavy cream</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh basil, divided</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound (454g) whole-milk mozzarella cheese, cut into rough 1/4-inch
        cubes and divided</li>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to
        400°F (200°C). Place ziti in a large bowl and cover with hot salted
        water by 3 or 4 inches. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes,
        stirring after the first 5 minutes to prevent sticking. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 3 cups of the red sauce into a large pot; add ricotta, half of
        the Parmigiano, eggs, cream, and half of the parsley and basil, and stir
        to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the soaked ziti
        along with half of the mozzarella cheese cubes and stir until well
        combined. Transfer to an ungreased 9- by 13-inch baking dish and top
        with the remaining 1 cup red sauce and mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease aluminum foil with cooking spray. Cover the baking dish
        tightly with the sprayed aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove
        foil and bake until the cheese beginsto brown, about 15 minutes longer.
        Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining Parmigiano, then let cool
        for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and basil and
        serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
